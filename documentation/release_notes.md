# Release Notes:
### June 19, 2020
    
#### [Local Execution Mode](documentation/Simulation_Execution.md)
* Default parallelization of Monte-Carlo / Stochastic simulations
* **Backwards Compatible** with given legacy modes names

#### [cadCAD Post-Processing Enhancements](https://github.com/BlockScience/distroduce/blob/master/documentation/dist_exec_doc.ipynb)
* Returns single dataset as three types depending on execution mode:
    * Local Mode: 
        * 2d List
* Changes:
    * Returning a single dataset was originally specified at the projectâ€™s inception instead of multiple per simulation
* [System Configuration Conversions](documentation/System_Configuration.md)
    * System Configuration as List of Configuration Objects
    * System Configuration as a Pandas DataFrame
    * System Configuration as List of Dictionaries

#### Backwards compatibility:
* Expandable state and policy update parameter space enables changes to the parameter space of updates while 
supporting backwards compatibility
* Legacy execution modes supported
